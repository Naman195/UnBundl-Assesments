1. HTML Structure:

The HTML file starts with the standard document structure, including a head section with meta tags and a link to an external CSS file.
The body contains a slider section with both the main slider content and thumbnail navigation.


2. CSS Styling:
The CSS file begins by importing the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts.
Styling is applied to the body, setting the font family, background color, and text color.
Styles for the header, including the logo and menu, are commented out, suggesting that this section might be intended for future development.
The main slider styles include positioning, transition effects, and keyframe animations for the content.
Arrow buttons for slider navigation and thumbnail styles are defined.
Media queries are used to adjust styles for smaller screens.

3. JavaScript Interaction:
The JavaScript file starts by selecting relevant elements from the DOM, such as slider items, next/prev buttons, and thumbnails.
The script configures parameters like the total number of items and the currently active item.
Event listeners are set up for the next and previous buttons, as well as for thumbnail clicks.
An interval is established to automatically advance the slider every 5 seconds.
The showSlider function is defined to handle the logic of displaying the active item, removing the old active item, and updating the interval.


4. Overall Approach:
The code follows a modular structure, separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Keyframe animations are used for smooth transitions in the slider content.
JavaScript handles user interactions, such as clicking next/prev buttons and thumbnail selection.
Thumbnails provide an alternative navigation method for users.

5. Reasoning:
Separation of concerns: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for behavior, following best practices.
Keyframe animations for smooth transitions between slider items.
Thumbnails provide an additional way for users to navigate directly to specific slides.
The use of setInterval for automatic slider progression.

1. HTML Structure:
You have a well-structured HTML document with the necessary elements like head, meta, title, and body.
The main content is enclosed in a <div class="container"> for styling purposes.

2. CSS Styling:
You've defined styles for the body, container, headings, chocolate options, selected chocolates, buttons, and modal.
The styling enhances the appearance and readability of the application, with a pleasant color scheme and button interactions.

3.JavaScript Logic:
Chocolate options and their prices are defined as an array of objects in the chocolateOptions variable.
The renderChocolateOptions function dynamically creates HTML elements for each chocolate option and appends them to the chocolate-options div.
Event listeners are attached to the "Add" and "Remove" buttons for each chocolate option.
The handleAddClick function adds a selected chocolate to the list and updates the total price. If the selection exceeds 8 chocolates, a modal is displayed to inform the user.
The handleRemoveClick function removes a selected chocolate from the list and updates the total price.
The renderSelectedChocolates function updates the displayed list of selected chocolates and the total price.

4. Modal for Exceeding Selection Limit:
You've implemented a modal (myModal) to inform the user when they try to select more than 8 chocolates.
The modal is displayed when the selection limit is reached, and it can be closed by clicking the close button or outside the modal.

5. Event Listeners and DOM Manipulation:
Event listeners are used to trigger functions based on user interactions, such as button clicks.
DOM manipulation is used to dynamically update the content of the page in response to user actions.
